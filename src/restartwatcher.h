/**
 * Restarts the keyboard when the binary this process runs from is updated.
 *
 * KWin keeps one plasma-keyboard-custom process running for the whole session,
 * so after a package update that process keeps executing the old code until the
 * session is restarted by hand. This class notices that the file on disk has
 * changed and asks KWin to start the input method again, with the same
 * configuration toggle a manual restart uses:
 *
 *     kwinrc [Wayland] InputMethod -> "" -> the previous value
 *
 * Emptying the setting makes KWin tear the running process down, restoring it
 * makes KWin start a fresh one, which picks up the new binary. The restart is
 * deferred while the panel is visible, so an update does not interrupt typing,
 * but only for a couple of minutes - it must not stay unapplied just because
 * the keyboard happens to be on screen. When this process is not the configured
 * input method the watcher stays idle, as KWin keeps no process of ours around
 * then anyway.
